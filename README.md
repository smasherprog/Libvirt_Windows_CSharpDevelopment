<h3>A framework to start Libvirt Development using CSharp on windows</h3>

<b>Prerequisite: </b> 7Zip http://www.7-zip.org/

<p>Begin by downloading this repo, then execute the ps1 powershell script. This will download all of the necessary dll's and auto generate the needed CSharp .cs PInvoke file from the libvirt headers.</p>
<br/>
<p>Once the script is done, you will have the dlls in the libvirt bin folder and a Libvirt.cs which contains all functions, structs, enums, delgates, etc . . . autogenerated from the libvirt C headers.</p>
<p>Remember to define _Win64 if you are doing a 64 bit build. Libvirt takes size_t as arguments which means the size can change based on 32 bit or 64 builds.</p>
