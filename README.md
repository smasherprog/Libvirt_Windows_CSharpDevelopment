<h3>A framework to start Libvirt Development using CSharp on windows</h3>

<b>Prerequisite: </b> 7Zip http://www.7-zip.org/

<p>Begin by downloading this repo, then execute the ps1 powershell script. This will download all of the necessary dll's and auto generate the needed CSharp .cs PInvoke file from the libvirt headers.</p>
<br/>
<p>Once the script is done, you will have the dlls in the libvirt bin folder and a Libvirt.cs which contains all functions, structs, enums, delgates, etc . . . autogenerated from the libvirt C headers.</p>

<p>Remember, when writing code, you must define a preprocessor macro of _Win64 or _Win32. This is because the libvirt library takes size_t as some arguments to functions so the build must be either 64 bit or 32 bit.</p>
